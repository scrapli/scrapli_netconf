        Determine if inputs are "echoed" back on stdout

        At least per early drafts of the netconf over ssh rfcs the netconf servers MUST NOT echo the
        input commands back to the client. In the case of "normal" scrapli netconf with the system
        transport this happens anyway because we combine the stdin and stdout fds into a single pty,
        however for other transports we have an actual stdin and stdout fd to read/write. It seems
        that at the very least IOSXE with NETCONF 1.1 seems to want to echo inputs back onto to the
        stdout for the channel. This is totally ok and we can deal with it, we just need to *know*
        that it is happening and that gives us somewhat of a dilemma... we want to give the device
        time to echo this data back to us, but we also dont want to just arbitrarily wait
        (especially in the more common case where the device is *not* echoing anything back). So we
        take 1/20th of the transport timeout and we wait that long to see -- if we get echo, we
        return immediately of course, otherwise there is an unfortunate slight delay here :(
